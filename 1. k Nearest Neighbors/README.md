## _k_ Nearest Neighbors (_kNN_)
Given a test image, the _kNN_ algorithm inspects the labels of the image's _k_ closest training set images and then assigns the majority label among them to the test image. <br /><br />

## Dataset
The dataset used in this experiment is CIFAR-10, which is a collection of 60,000 32x32 images, each belonging to one of ten pre-defined labels: _airplane_, _automobile_, _bird_, _cat_, _deer_, _dog_, _frog_, _horse_, _ship_, and _truck_. <br />
