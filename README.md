# Computer-Vision
This repository contains codes written primarily in Python (using PyTorch) for implementing various neural-network-based solutions for computer vision (CV) problems. Additionally, there is a subrepo containing codes written in C for implementing several traditional CV algorithms.

**Python packages used:** <br />
Numpy <br />
Matplotlib <br />
PyTorch <br />

**Sample solutions:** <br />
