## Classification models
We use the following classification models to classify images into different classes: <br /><br />
**Support Vector Machine (SVM):** <br />
A SVM Classifier will be implemented with a fully-vectorized loss-function, which will be optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). <br /><br />
**Softmax Classifier:** <br />
A Softmax Classifier will be implemented with a softmax loss-function, which will be optimized using SGD. <br /><br />
**Fully-connected deep neural network:** <br />
A deep neural network with fully-connected layers is trained using a Softmax loss-function and an L<sub>2</sub> regularizer. The network uses a non-linear ReLU activation in its hidden layer. The network's architecture is: <br />
I/P-FC-ReLU-FC-Softmax <br /><br />

All the above classification models will unravel an image into a row vector before classifying it, resulting in a loss of spatial information and low accuracies. However, the accuracies will be higher than what resulted from the use of the _k_ nearest neighbors algorithm. <br /><br />

## Dataset
The dataset used in this experiment is CIFAR-10, which is a collection of 60,000 3x32x32 images, each belonging to one of ten pre-defined labels: _plane_, _car_, _bird_, _cat_, _deer_, _dog_, _frog_, _horse_, _ship_, and _truck_. <br />
