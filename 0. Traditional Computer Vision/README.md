# Computer-Vision
This repository contains codes written in C for solving various computer vision (CV) problems using traditional (no deep learning involved) approaches. The following is a list of all implementations: <br />
1. Mean filter <br />
1. Optical character recognition <br />
1. Thinning, branchpoint, and endpoint detection <br />
1. Region interaction <br />
1. Motion tracking <br />
1. Active contours <br />
